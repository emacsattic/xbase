2002-05-22 12:02 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-keyword-face): Added.
	(xbase-directive-face): Added.
	(xbase-command-face): Added.
	(xbase-string-face): Added.
	(xbase-mode): Put font lock support for strings back in. Used the
	above variables to control which faces are used for the various
	font locking rules. Made full use of `regexp-opt' by getting it to
	place the word markers in the resulting regular expression.
	(xbase-font-lock-directives): Removed the preceeding "#" from each
	entry in the list.
	(xbase-mode): Added the "#" to the start of the use of
	`xbase-font-lock-directives' when setting up the font lock rules.

2002-05-22 10:55 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-some-statement-indentation): Modified to handle
	cases where there is nothing to match to. Now, when there is
	nothing to be matched for finding the previous indentation level
	the current level is used.

2002-05-22 10:47 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-indent-rules): STATIC/INIT/EXIT functions and
	procedures are now catered for.

2002-05-22 10:18 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-font-lock-commands): Added.
	(xbase-mode): Changed value of `font-lock-defaults' to use the above.

2002-05-22 10:16 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-font-lock-keywords): Renamed to `xbase-font-lock-statements'.
	(xbase-mode): Changed value of `font-lock-defaults' to use the above.

2002-05-22 10:11 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-calculate-offset): Removed.
	(xbase-calculate-indent-with-offset): Added. This replaces
	`xbase-calculate-offset'. The main difference is that a specific
	column value is now supported as an "offset". This means that the
	likes of TEXT/ENDTEXT can support having the intervening text at
	column zero.
	(xbase-some-statement-indentation): Added.
	(xbase-previous-opening-statement-indentation) Changed to use the
	above.
	(xbase-previous-opening/interim-statement-indentation): Changed to
	use the above.
	(xbase-indent-level): Changed to use
	`xbase-calculate-indent-with-offset'.
	(xbase-indent-rules): Added TEXT/ENDTEXT support.

2002-05-22 09:04 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el: Major re-working of indentation code and font lock
	code.

2002-05-20 17:50 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-mode): Removed `make-local-variable' declaration
	for `xbase-indent-level', no such buffer local variable is
	required.

2002-05-20 16:12 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-mode): Made sure that `indent-line-function' is
	a buffer local variable before setting it to `xbase-indent-line'.

2002-05-20 14:39 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el: Renamed symbols using "select" in their name to
	"do-case".

2002-05-20 10:13 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-mode): Changed `mode-name' from "xBase" to
	"Xbase".

2002-05-20 10:09 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-label-regexp): Removed.

2002-05-20 10:08 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-*-regexp): Made all lower case.
	(xbase-indent-level): Bind `case-fold-search' to t so that regular
	expression matches are case insensitive.

2002-05-18 12:03 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-indent-level): Removed code that saved `point'
	it wasn't necessary because `save-excursion' is being used.

2002-05-18 11:39 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-mode): Added autoload marker.

2002-05-18 11:38 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-mode): Actually use `xbase-mode-map'.
	Set all values in one `setq'.

2002-05-18 11:37 UTC+0100  Dave Pearson  <davep@davep.org>

	* xbase.el (xbase-case-regexp): Added "otherwise".
